      "message": "This change needs discussed among the ATV maintainers. Disabling these warnings should be determined at a product level and not by individual devices. Atm, only tegra has 64-bit atv targets, but there\u0027s nothing intrinsic preventing other 64-bit targets from existing. I think this should be merged until GMS apps at least stop triggering it.",
